# CocoaReactComponentKit

CocoaReactComponentKit is [ReactComponentKit](https://github.com/ReactComponentKit/ReactComponentKit) for Cocoa, Mac OS X. CocoaReactComponentKit is a library for building NSViewControllers. You can make NSViewControllers based on Components. Also, It uses MVVM and Redux architectures for unidirectional data flow.

## Data Flow

 * (1) : Components dispatch actions
 * (2) : ViewModel passes the actions to the store. You can use beforeDispatch(action:) method to do some work before dispatching actions.
 * (3) : Store passed current state to the Redux pipeline. Middlewares, Reducers and Postwares make a new state.
 * (4) : New State comes out from the Redux pipeline. It is passed to the store.
 * (5) : Store passes the new state to the ViewModel.
 * (6) : ViewModel passes or propagates the state to the Components.

## Components

CocoaReactComponentKit provides four components basically. 

 * NSViewComponent
 	* It is a basic component for making a scene. It is just a NSView that has some convenient methods for dispatching actions and receiving states.
 * NSCollectionViewComponent
 	* It is a component for making a scene that uses NSCollectionView.
 * NSTableViewComponent
 	* It is a component for making a scene that uses NSTableView which has only one column.
 * NSViewControllerComponent
 	* It is a component for spliting a massive view controller.
